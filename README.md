# Global-CO2-Emissions-Analysis-Using-Tableau
Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze global CO₂ emissions from 1960–2023, showcasing top emitters, regional patterns, and long-term trends through advanced visualizations and filters.

Task 1:
Data Cleaning And Preprocessing:
○ Rename value to CO2_Emissions_kt for clarity.
○ Ensure year is treated as a dimension for trend analysis.
○ Filter out countries with no emissions data (value IS NULL).
○ Create calculated fields for emissions in mt (megatonnes) and percentage change year-on-year.

Task 2:
Visual Analysis
○ Bar Chart: Top 10 CO₂ Emitting Countries (Latest Year).
○ Scatter Plot: Global CO₂ Emissions Trend.
○ Map: CO₂ Emissions by Country (Latest Year).
○ Area Chart: Stacked Emissions by Continent or Region.

Task 3:
Interactive Dashboards And Advanced Visualizations:
○ Slicer/Filters: Year range slider and dropdown for country_name. 
○ Scatter Plot: CO₂ Emissions versus Year.
○ Highlight Table: Emissions heatmap.
